### this is a tiny toy project

#### it is forked from [this project](https://github.com/chaishilin/Tiny-webserver)

#### i use it to learn the basics of c++, sockets, etc.

### notes

#### client.cpp and server-fork.cpp are the basics

#### client-select.cpp and server-select.cpp are relatively higher level

#### use '''nc -zv 127.0.0.1 12345''' to check if the port 12345 is able to connect
